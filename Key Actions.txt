Project 4, 3D velocity field curve and particle simulation

VELOCITY FIELD CURVE:
t: show tube, x: move selected point XY, z: move selected point XZ
v: move all XY, b: move all XZ, S: save, L: load 
i: insert control point, c: delete control point, a: append control point


PARTICLE GENERATOR:
pressed G and mouse drag left/ right: change emission rate
pressed g and mouse drag left/ right: change size of the generator,  n:move XY, m:move XZ
pressed , and mouse click on a point: move the generator to that point instantly

OBSTACLE (earth): 
press e and mouse drag left/ right: change size of obstacle
O: move XY, o: move XZ

GRAVITY: 
u: turn on gravity effect 
pressed U and mouse drag left/ right: change the strength of the gravitational force (set gravity const)

OTHER PARAMETERS:
f: add dynamic, pressed s and mouse drag left/ right: change blend parameter
D: Moves E forward/backward (enlarge), d: Moves E forward/backward and rotates around (F,Y) 
Mouse Drag only: rotating the view point, Q: quit
